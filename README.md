# Project-Recursion

Applying what I have learned about recursion so far, my goal is to solve two classic problems: Fibonacci and Merge Sort.

## Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence.

The first step was to write a function `fibsForLoop` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

**Example:** 
    
    ```
     Using an example input of 8,
     return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
    
    ```

The next step was to write another function `fibsRecursion` that solves the same problem recursively.
